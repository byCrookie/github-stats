# github-stats

A streamlined version of [anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
implemented in rust to reduce resource
consumption. This implementation uses filesystem caching to minimize memory usage.

# Example

![byCrookie's Github Stats](https://github-stats.bycrookie.com/all)

# Usage

If the application is running, open a browser and navigate to the root of the application. The application will return
a json view of all possible endpoints.

# Self-hosting

It is recommended to use docker to self-host the application. Follow the instructions in the [Docker](#docker) section.

# Environment

Use environment variables or .env file to supply values.
